Revision history for Perl extension Inline::CPP.

0.20  Wed May  2 23:00:50 PDT 2001
	- Made Inline::CPP a subclass of Inline::C. Moved most functionality
	  into Inline::C, and trimmed code a lot.
	- Fixed bug in handling of 'LIBS' config option. Added a 'ALTLIBS'
	  config option which adds a new element to the list of alternate
	  libs.
	- Added 'PRESERVE_ELLIPSIS' option, which prevents Inline::CPP from
	  replacing '...' arguments with nothing.
	- Inline::CPP now works on Cygwin!
	- Grammar improvements:
		- Inline functions
		- Inheritance
		- Default parameters: void foo(int a=10, char *b="Hello");
		- Unnamed parameters: void foo(int, char *);
		- Support for public, private and protected scopes
		- 'structs' are now bound just like classes, except the
		  default scope is public.
		- Support for no fixed arguments: void foo(...);
