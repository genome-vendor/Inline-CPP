INTRODUCTION:

Inline::CPP -- Write Perl subroutines and classes in C++.

Inline::CPP lets you write Perl subroutines and classes in C++. You
don't have to learn XS or SWIG, you can just put code right "inline"
in your source.

Example:

   use Inline CPP => <<'END';

   class JAxH {
     public:
       JAxH(char *x);

       SV* data();
     private:
       SV *dat;
   };

   JAxH::JAxH(char *x) { dat = newSVpvf("Just Another %s Hacker", x); }
   SV* JAxH::data() { return dat; }

   END

   print JAxH->new('Inline')->data(), "\n";

When run, this complete program prints:

   Just Another Inline Hacker.

FEATURES:

Inline::CPP version 0.25 is a minor upgrade from previous versions. It
includes:

+ works with Parse::RecDescent 1.90 and later
+ use a fully-qualified path to g++ based on $Config{gccversion} if perl was
  compiled with gcc
+ a syntax error in the POD has been fixed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

This module requires Inline::C.pm version 0.42 or higher to be installed.

To install Inline::CPP do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

(On ActivePerl for MSWin32, use nmake instead of make.)

You have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully.
