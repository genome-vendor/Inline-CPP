INTRODUCTION:

Inline::CPP -- Write Perl subroutines and classes in C++.

Inline::CPP lets you write Perl subroutines and classes in C++. You
don't have to learn XS or SWIG, you can just put code right "inline"
in your source.

Example:

   use Inline CPP => <<'END';

   class JAxH {
     public:
       JAxH(char *x);

       SV* data();
     private:
       SV *dat;
   };

   JAxH::JAxH(char *x) { dat = newSVpvf("Just Another %s Hacker", x); }
   SV* JAxH::data() { return dat; }

   END

   print JAxH->new('Inline')->data(), "\n";

When run, this complete program prints:

   Just Another Inline Hacker.

FEATURES:

Inline::CPP version 0.13 is a minor upgrade from previous versions. It includes:

+ More XS and MakeMaker features exposed.
+ Improved support for Win32.
  + Adds the '-TP' flag to force C++ compilation of the XS glue.
+ Added workaround for AIX bug in Config.pm.
+ Better error messages.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

This module requires Inline.pm version 0.31 or higher to be installed.

To install Inline::CPP do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

(On ActivePerl for MSWin32, use nmake instead of make.)

You have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully.
